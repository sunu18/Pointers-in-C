## Pointers-in-C
In C programming language, a pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are useful when you need to work with memory directly, such as when you want to dynamically allocate memory, pass arguments to functions by reference, or manipulate arrays.

Here is an example of how to define a pointer in C:

In this example, we have defined a pointer named ptr that points to an integer variable. The * symbol indicates that ptr is a pointer variable.

You can assign a memory address to a pointer using the address-of operator &, as shown below:

In this example, we have assigned the memory address of the var variable to the ptr pointer
